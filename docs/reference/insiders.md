# Insiders

The Visual Studio Live Share team tries to iterate rapidly in order to address user feedback, and as part of that, we offer two seperate feature "channels" that allow you to decide how quickly you recieve new features. By default, after installing the Visual Studio Live Share extension, you're using the `Stable` feature set, which includes all of the production-ready capabilities (e.g. co-editing, shared debugging, terminals). However, if you'd like to get early access to feature we're working on, you can opt-in to the `Insiders` feature set by changing the following setting in your IDE:

* Visual Studio

    ![feature-set-vs](../media/feature-set-vs.png)

* Visual Studio Code 

    ![feature-set-vscode](../media/feature-set-vscode.png)
